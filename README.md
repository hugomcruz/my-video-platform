# My Video Platform

When my daughter was born I decided to buy a Camcorder to register the best moments. I put myself for video edition, to create nice videos representing my daughter's evolution. Some of these videos became a mash up of HD camcorder videos and iPhone. 

In the old days I would burn these into DVD, and play them. But with this solution, I could not share the videos easily to the rest of the family, and I did not have a BluRay player and recorder to keep the HD videos. 

I decided to create my own personal "Channel" to be easy to visulize these videos and created:
- Roku Player application
- Server side app to feed the Roku

And after buying a Roku for each TV in the house and offering to my partens and my in laws, everyone can now view the videos. But, due to lack of time, because I have a very full time busy job, this platform has some limitations. 

Later, I expanded this platform to rip DVD's with child cartoons, so that I could provide another Cartoon application for my daughter to watch cartoons in the 3 languages that she speaks, always based on the base video code. 

# Current Code
The current code shared in the repository is:
- Video Application brightscript
- Backend PHP code to feed the Roku App 

I have other scripts to automatically create videos from mobile phone videos uploaded to a dropbox, but these are not part of the code being shares, however I can share with interestes parties.


# Next Steps
The next steps would be improving this eco-system with:
- iOS and Android applications with capability to stream the videos and store them locally
- web UI to manage the videos
- Improve the backend
- Improve the Roku application
- Create App for other media boxes and Smart TVs

I would be looking for people, with the same interest in having a personal video serser, with some of the following skills, that could put some effort in create a better platform. 
- Web Developer
- iOS Developer
- BrightScript (Roku) Developer
- Backend Developer - PHP, Go, MySQL, FFMpeg (video manipulation software)
