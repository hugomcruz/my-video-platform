# My Video Platform

When my daughter was born I decided to buy a Camcorder to register the best moments. I put myself for video edition, to create nice videos representing my daughter's evolution. Some of these videos became a mash up of HD camcorder videos and iPhone. 

In the old days I would burn these into DVD, and play them. But with this solution, I could not share the videos easily to the rest of the family, and I did not have a BluRay player and recorder to keep the HD videos. 

I decided to create my own personal "Channel" to be easy to visulize these videos and created:
- Roku Player application
- Server side app to feed the Roku

And after buying a Roku for each TV in the house and offering to my partens and my in laws, everyone can now view the videos. But, due to lack of time, because I have a very full time busy job, this platform has some limitations.
